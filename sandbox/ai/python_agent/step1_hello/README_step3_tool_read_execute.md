# tool calls

what the response looks like:

```js
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": null,
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "id": "call_abc123",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
              "name": "Read",
              "arguments": "{\"file_path\": \"/path/to/file.txt\"}"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      "finish_reason": "tool_calls"
    }
  ]
}
```

The key fields you need to handle are:

* `choices`: The list of generated responses. For this challenge, there will always be exactly **one choice**.

* `tool_calls`: The array of tool calls to make

  * `id`: A unique identifier for the tool call

  * `type`: The type of tool call (always `"function"` for tools)

  * `function`: Contains the function details:

    * `name`: The name of the function to call (e.g., `"Read"`)
    * `arguments`: A JSON string containing the function parameters

For this stage, you'll execute a single `Read` tool call.

### Executing the `Read` Tool

When you detect a `tool_calls` array in the response:

1. **Extract the tool call**: Get the message from the first choice, then extract the first tool call from the `tool_calls` array.
2. **Parse the function name**: Read the function name to determine which tool to execute.
3. **Parse the arguments**: Parse the function arguments as a JSON string to get the parameters.
4. **Execute the tool**: Your program must perform the action requested. For the `Read` tool, use your language's file system library to read the file at the requested `file_path`.
5. **Output the result**: Print the tool execution result. For the `Read` tool, print the raw file contents directly to stdout (just the contents, with no labels or formatting).

In previous stages, you printed the message content directly to stdout. Now that the model's response can include tool calls, you should **only print the message content if there's no `tool_calls` array** in the response.

### Tests

The tester will create a file (e.g., `apple.py`) and execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh -p "What is the content of apple.py? Print exact file contents without backticks."
<file contents>
```
