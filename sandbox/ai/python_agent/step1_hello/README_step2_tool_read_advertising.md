In this stage, you'll add support for advertising the `Read` tool in the request.

### Tools

Tools are functions that an LLM can use to perform specific actions, like reading files or running commands.

By default, LLMs cannot access a user's environment, such as their filesystem or terminal. To solve this, Claude Code provides several [tools](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) (like `Read`, `Write`, and `Bash`) that enable the model to read and modify the user's codebase.

For this stage, you only need to advertise the `Read` tool (you’ll implement it in later stages).

### Advertising Tools

Advertising tools lets the model know which tools are available and what arguments they accept.

To advertise tools, edit the existing request in the starter code to add a `tools` array:

```diff
 {
   "model": "...",
   "messages": [...],
+  "tools": [<tool1 spec>, <tool2 spec>, ...]
 }
```

For this stage, the `tools` array should include the `Read` tool's specification:

```js
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "Read",
    "description": "Read and return the contents of a file",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "file_path": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The path to the file to read"
        }
      },
      "required": ["file_path"]
    }
  }
}
```

The structure consists of the following fields:

* `type`: The type of tool (always `"function"` for tools)

* `function`: Contains the function definition

  * `name`: The name of the function (e.g., "Read")

  * `description`: Explains the function's purpose and helps the LLM determine when to use it.

  * `parameters`: A JSON schema describing the function's parameters

    * `properties`: Defines each parameter (in this case, just `file_path`)
    * `required`: Lists which parameters are mandatory

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh -p "How many tools are available to you in this request? Number only."
1
```

The tester will verify that:

* Your program outputs a positive number
* Your program exits with exit code `0`

### Notes

* You can choose any reasonable name for the `Read` tool. The tester will only perform end-to-end tests by checking the LLM's response. For example, any of the following names is valid:

  * `Read`
  * `read`
  * `read_file`
  * `ReadFile`, etc.

* For this stage, you only need to advertise the `Read` tool's availability in the request. We'll handle tool calls in later stages.
