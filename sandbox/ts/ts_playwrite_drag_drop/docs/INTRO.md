i want to build a test prove of concept for drag and drop using playwrite and typescript.

level 1:
- create a drag and drop application
- test the drag and drop functionality

level 2:
- i need to drag and drop also from one window to another
- create an application that can switch between drag elements or drop elements, when i have both oppened and run the playwright test, i need to be able to drag the element from one to the other

level 3:
- create an application with several elements that are draggable, find one with a specific text on it and drag it to the drop element
- the application must generate the elements in random position to validate the finding of the element

technologies:
- typescript
- playwrite
- angular for the application
- taskfile for the tasks
